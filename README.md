# Queryable java docs!

This project containes classes and methods of Java, which are searchable.

## Problem we are solving!

Whenever we solve a problem in Java, we might use google to find or search for a method and spend a good amount of time to just figure out whether a method is present in a class or not. What if we can query whether a specific method is available in Java or in a specific java class? Wouldn't it make developers life easy?

## Our Goal

To build a web app, which can query methods & classes in Java!
